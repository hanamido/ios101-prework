  * Having videos play in the background
  * Preview videos before seeing them
* Notion
  * Clean, minimalistic UI
  * AI filling out of notes
* Amazon
  * Being able to view and save items for later
  * Clear buttons 

Think of an app idea that you would like to build. It can be a new idea or an improvement on an existing app. Write a short paragraph describing the app and the features you would like to implement. You are not commiting to this idea, but it helps to start brain storming early on and get feedback from your peers and instructors.
I would like to build an app that can recommend random recipes for a user based on the ingredients they currently have at the time, or suggest a restaurant based on what they feel like that day. Some of the features I would like to implement are the ability to save recipes completed, like their favorite recipes, and give feedback for recipes that they had a hard time with or that they did not enjoy. I would also like to implement a feature where users can get a streak going for home-cooked dinners, to encourage healthier eating habits.
