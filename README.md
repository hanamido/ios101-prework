Make a list of your favorite 3-5 applications and identify 2-3 features that make them your favorite app. Its okay if features repeat on different apps
* Youtube
  * Viewing videos in Light/Dark Mode
* Preview of videos
* Facebook
* Amazon
Think of an app idea that you would like to build. It can be a new idea or an improvement on an existing app. Write a short paragraph describing the app and the features you would like to implement. You are not commiting to this idea, but it helps to start brain storming early on and get feedback from your peers and instructors.
* Being notified once video from playlist has been deleted.
